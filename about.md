## Who We Are

True North Tundra Junk isn't just a company; it's a passion project born out of a love for vehicles and a commitment to sustainability. With my trusty flatbed tow truck, I specialize in giving unwanted vehicles a new lease on life.

## Our Mission

At True North Tundra Junk, we're on a mission to transform old and unused vehicles into fresh opportunities. We buy vehicles that are no longer needed and give them a chance to contribute to a greener future.
