Welcome to True North Tundra Junk ðŸš—ðŸ”§

At True North Tundra Junk, we're not just in the business of vehicles â€“ we're in the business of turning unwanted rides into fresh opportunities. My name is Brandon, and I'm the proud owner of this endeavor, committed to providing a seamless solution for those looking to part ways with their vehicles while contributing to a sustainable future.

Tundra Junk

Our Mission
Our mission is simple yet impactful: to give a new life to vehicles that have served their purpose. With a flatbed tow truck ready to hit the road, we specialize in buying vehicles that people no longer need, and then giving them the chance to be reborn as valuable resources.

Why Choose Us?
âœ… Transparency: We believe in open communication and fairness throughout the process.
âœ… Professionalism: Our team handles every step with the utmost professionalism and care.
âœ… Sustainability: By recycling and repurposing, we're contributing to a greener environment.
âœ… Hassle-Free: Say goodbye to the hassle of selling your vehicle privately â€“ we've got you covered.

"Turning the old into new possibilities."
